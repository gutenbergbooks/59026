<h3>RECENT NOTICES.</h3>

<h4><i>From the North American and United States’ Gazette.</i></h4>

<p>We have received from Messrs. E. C. &amp; J. Biddle the last number of the
Pennsylvania Journal of Prison Discipline, which is published quarterly, under
the direction of the Philadelphia Society for alleviating the Miseries of Public
Prisons. A glance through its pages shows what is well understood&mdash;that it is a
highly valuable periodical, communicating much and various important information
upon the subject of which it treats. It is the only publication of the kind in
the country, is certainly a very much needed one, and ought, therefore, to be well
sustained by the public.</p>

<h4>OBITUARY NOTICE.</h4>

<p>It is not long since the Philadelphia Society for Alleviating
the Miseries of Public Prisons recorded the decease of the last
of its founders; the survivor of that little group of enlightened
and benevolent men, who, in the year 1787, commenced the
work of prison reform in Pennsylvania. The society has now
to add to the roll of the departed, the name of one who is to be
henceforth associated with the history of that reform, as the
chief pioneer of its architectural progress. They who, in wisdom
and the love of their kind, conceived the morality of our
discipline, and their fellow-laborer who faithfully and earnestly
and successfully sought to give to it an outward embodiment
adapted to its complex designs, now sleep together. Our readers
will participate in the interest with which we recall some
of the leading incidents of a life so closely connected as was
that of John Haviland, with the great subject to which our
pages are devoted.</p>

<p>Mr. Haviland was born on the 15th of December, 1792, in
the county of Somerset, England. He was the son of James
Haviland, of Gundenham Manor, in that county, and of Ann,
daughter of the Rev. Benjamin Cobley, of Ide in the county of
Devon, Rector of Dodbrook. His academic studies were completed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
in his native county; and as his tastes, even in boyhood,
inclined him towards the profession of an architect, he removed
to London, and became a pupil of James Elmes. His preparatory
training under that gentleman had been scarcely finished,
when his enterprise was solicited by inducements from abroad.
A sister of his mother had married an officer of distinction in
the Russian naval service, who was then Minister of Marine,
under the Emperor Alexander, Count Morduinoff. As this
gentleman was disposed to promote the advancement of his
young relative, the latter hoped, through his influence, to obtain
an appointment in the imperial corps of engineers, and promptly
accepted an invitation from him to visit St. Petersburg. Upon
arriving in Russia, and considering the various motives presented
for the guidance of his future career, particularly the
reports which had been received of the state of architecture in
this country, and of the opening existing here for professional
skill and activity, Mr. Haviland, in accordance with the advice
of his friends, resolved to embark for America. He was
furnished with letters of introduction, amongst which was one
from General Von Sonntag, who had been a resident at Philadelphia,
and whose sister Mr. Haviland subsequently married.
He landed in this city in September, 1816.</p>

<p>With this portion of our sketch, there are associations which
deserve to be mentioned, not only because of their intrinsic
value, but because they are in beautiful harmony with later
events, and must have influenced, in some degree, the thoughts
and feelings of our architect. When the philanthropist Howard
was at Cherson, in 1789-90, he formed an acquaintance
with Admiral Morduinoff, then chief of the Black Sea
fleet. Their relations soon ripened into those of an intimate
friendship, which was cemented both by the amiable qualities
of the Russian officer, and by his warm sympathy with the
feelings and plans of the reformer. When the latter fell a victim
to the infection to which he had exposed himself, his last
moments were attended by Morduinoff. The memory of this
honorable friendship was reverently cherished by the survivor,
who loved to dwell upon the discoveries and designs of the
great Englishman; and we cannot doubt, that the young Haviland
became an auditor of precious reminiscences. It is certain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
that the friend who shared the last sympathetic throb of the
heart of Howard, was he whose hand was extended to guide
towards our country the architect, under whose directing skill,
was to arise the most complete embodiment which the world
had seen, of Howard’s reform.</p>

<p>It was not long after his arrival here, that Mr. Haviland
found an opportunity for the exercise of his professional skill.
Amongst his first public works was the Presbyterian church on
Washington Square; an edifice which, compared with the latest
of our churches, ranks well with respect to the chief conveniences
of such a structure; and which, if judged by the buildings
existing here at the date of its erection, gives a very favorable
idea of the young artist’s capability, and of the liberal scope of
his mind. It is not, however, our purpose to review his works,
except in connection with our penal institutions; towards which
he soon found himself directed by the wants of his adopted
state. After a series of appeals to the legislature, and finally to
the public, the Prison Society, acting in conjunction with the
officers of our prisons, had succeeded in obtaining (in 1818) the
enactment of a law, authorizing the construction of a prison for
convicts, at Pittsburg, in the western part of the State. Amongst
the plans which were offered to the judgment of the commissioners,
appointed to superintend the construction, was one
presented by Mr. H. We regret not to be able through an
inspection of this plan to exhibit the earliest conception of his
mind upon such a subject; the preference was given to another
design, and his drawings are not within our reach. The choice
of the commissioners was unfortunate, as there will be occasion
hereafter to notice.</p>

<p>The insufficiency of the prisons in the eastern part of the
State, became the motive to further applications to the government;
and in the year 1821, an act of the legislature provided
for the erection of a State Penitentiary, at Philadelphia. Mr.
Haviland again entered into the competition of architects, and
was successful in obtaining and maintaining the direction of the
work, not only during its early progress, but until the completion
of the last block of cells. As it is by this institution, that
his reputation has been most widely extended, it may not be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
inappropriate to recall some of the peculiar circumstances in
which his skill was exerted.</p>

<p>We are here reminded of the just observation of an English
author, that “innumerable are the services to truth, to justice,
or society, which never can be adequately valued by those who
reap their benefits, simply because the transition from the early
and bad state, to the final or improved state, cannot be retraced
or kept alive before the eyes. The record perishes. The last
point gained is seen; but the starting point, the point <i>from</i>
which it was gained, is forgotten.” This remark is the more
impressive when applied to human works upon any subject
which, from its nature, tends always to an improvement keeping
pace with the special experience, and with the general enlightenment
of a community. That which costs an effort to
the most enterprising inventor of to-day, will shortly become
familiar; then the basis of new reforms; and finally, will rank
only as one of the earliest of a long series of developments.
The tendency to generalize, and to mistake resemblances which
are easily seen after a contrivance has become familiar, for the
real succession of ideas by which a reformer was led to his
discoveries and plans, has always had the effect to conceal
from posterity the true difficulties of any achievement in their
behalf. Hence the influence properly attributable to the intervention
of an individual in the affairs of society, cannot be
accurately judged, unless there be first considered the state of
the case as it appeared to his immediate predecessors, and his
contemporaries. It will of course be impossible, within the
limits allotted to this sketch, to do more than indicate the topics
to which the reader’s attention is invited; yet enough may be
said to lead him easily to the principal grounds of the conclusion
which the writer has in view.</p>

<p>The visits of Howard to the prisons of Europe, had brought
to public notice not only the miserable condition of the discipline
in most of them, but also many of their principal defects
of construction. The modifications of interior management first
suggested for convicts in England, and subsequently enlarged
and carried into successful operation in Pennsylvania, required
great alterations of material structure. The design was to
pass from a state of things, in which there was an indiscriminate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
association of prisoners without labor, without instruction,
without government, almost without restraint, except that of
walls, chains, and the brutal tyranny of the strongest or boldest
among the prisoners, to a state in which separation, good order,
cleanliness, labor, instruction, and ready and continual supervision
should be maintained, within the limits of such fiscal
economy as public opinion and resources rendered expedient.
The earliest and most noted experiments were made at Horsham,
Petworth, and Gloucester, in England; and in the old
Walnut street gaol, at Philadelphia. The record of these
attempts fortunately still remains; and it would be superfluous
to discuss their want of adaptedness to any large scheme of
separate discipline. The next remarkable effort was at Pittsburg,
where a circular prison was erected, so illy suited to its
objects, that in less than ten years after its completion, it was
demolished. The next step of progress was the erection of the
Eastern Penitentiary; and it must be obvious, that much was
involved in the success or failure of its architect. There was
not in all Europe a building suited to the objects of the contemplated
work. Since the alteration of the Walnut street
gaol, there had been more than a quarter of a century of observation
and reflection, and discussion; and the principal monument
of these, visible amongst ourselves, was the Western
Penitentiary, which had not yet been tried, and which was at
that time recommended not only by the professional judgment
which devised it, but by what is often more influential, the
prestige of government favor, and public expectation. It was
in such circumstances, that Mr. Haviland undertook to solve
the problem entrusted to him. It is probable, that he scanned,
as he was bound to do, all the resources of his profession, as
far as these had been manifested in structures within reach of
his means of information. It is probable that he felt the importance
of his position, and that he inquired anxiously; and
that he labored intently upon the materials of design, availing
himself of light from every quarter; but let us judge of his procedure
by its result. The chief objects of prison architecture,
sought by the friends of separate discipline, were for the first
time attained. The impression upon the public mind was so
remarkable, that it must fix the attention of the most careless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
reviewer; and we have, moreover, been furnished with a test
of unusual value, by which to determine how far our architect
comprehended his position. The British government meditating
a change of penal discipline, and the French and Prussian
governments with a like design, sent commissioners to the
United States, to examine the penitentiaries. Those gentlemen
had previous knowledge of prison architecture in Europe; and
they visited the prisons of greatest reputation in America; and
they found our discipline administered with a success unparalleled.
When they returned to their respective governments,
the plans which they reported for adoption, were essentially
the same with that of the Eastern Penitentiary. During their
visits to Philadelphia, they received from Mr. Haviland, communications
of his experience, which were made to them with
the generous frankness which eminently characterized him as a
professional man. Some idea of the impression produced by
his work, and by his liberal zeal for the promotion of good construction
abroad, may be formed from the following translated
extract, from a letter addressed to him by the French commissioner,
M. Blouet, himself a distinguished architect. It accompanied
a copy of his official report, presented in the joint names
of himself, and his associate commissioner, M. Demetz.</p>

<p>“M. Demetz and myself request your acceptance of a copy
of the report which we have made to our government at the
termination of the mission, upon which we visited the United
States to examine your penitentiary system. As you may see
by our report, the establishments constructed by yourself have
been the chief source from which we have drawn; and they
are also the models which we propose as the best, and the most
perfectly conceived for satisfying the physical and the moral
conditions of penitentiary reform. We hope that you will
accept the particular expression of our sincere compliments,
upon the very honorable part which you have had in the erection
of establishments so remarkable in every point of view.</p>

<p>“For myself, sir, as an architect, I cannot too often repeat
to you that both the design, and the execution of your works
have interested me in the highest degree; and it gives me real
pleasure to offer you my sincere thanks for the obliging manner
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
in which you have furnished me with the information needed
for my studies in your interesting country.”</p>

<p>Such testimony is the more impressive, when we remember
that it comes from a gentleman who had not only exhibited
convincing proofs of his fitness for the responsible duty to which
he was called by his government, but who had at the same
time shown his freedom from the constraints of mere imitation.
As justly remarked by M. Moreau-Christophe, the plan of Mr.
Haviland was not servilely copied; but while endeavoring to
accommodate some of its details to peculiarities of religion,
national character and climate, M. Blouet rendered his hearty
tribute of acknowledgment, alike honorable to himself and to its
object, for the reform which he had witnessed in the main
elements of the design.</p>

<p>The most striking mode of illustrating the facts, is to assemble
plans of the chief prisons erected before the Eastern Penitentiary,
and to compare them with the plans of separate
prisons for convicts, since constructed. It will be apparent at
the first glance, that there has been a sudden and radical
change, and that the Eastern Penitentiary is the head of the
new series. Even in many particulars, in which the old
and the new forms may exhibit a resemblance, there will be
found an essential difference in the principle of the design; the
same feature being found to have a different object, or a different
relative value.</p>

<p>The influence of the reputation acquired by such success,
was immediately felt in the enlargement of Mr. Haviland’s
sphere of professional exertion. At the same time that he was
occupied with the completion of the series of cell-blocks at
Cherry Hill, he was also engaged upon several other similar
works. The Western Penitentiary having been proved to be
unsuited to its objects, he was invited, about the year 1834, to
superintend its reconstruction in conformity with the plan of
the Eastern. The authorities of the county of Alleghany requested
his direction of the prison of that county, then about to
be built; and he also drew the plan of its Court House. The
State Penitentiary of New Jersey, was built by him after the
model of Pennsylvania; and he also designed and superintended
the erection of the prison of Essex county, in New Jersey, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
the Halls of Justice, (the city prison,) of New York. The
nearly simultaneous direction of these buildings at places very
remote one from another, required an extraordinary energy and
power of endurance. In 1841, the prison of Dauphin county
was constructed by him at Harrisburg, the capital of the State;
and it was at that time generally regarded as the best example
in this country of a small county jail. It would be unfair to
judge of the details of the preceding works, by a comparison
of them with the latest and most costly specimens of this class
of buildings. The English government at a great expense, and
with a generous liberality of encouragement, of which there
was no parallel in the United States, procured a series of experiments
upon the ventilation of large buildings, and upon the
fitness of various kinds of walls for the necessities of our discipline;
and authorized the construction of a model prison, upon
which were lavished the best science and art within reach of
the commissioners; and the result was naturally an improvement
in the details of contrivance, as well as in the material
execution of these. The heating, ventilation, means of prompt
communication, and other particulars of security and comfort
were established by methods superior to any which had been
previously in use in this country. The yards for exercise, which
as first tried at Cherry Hill, were found to shade too much the
cells on the ground floor, were detached and placed in the
spaces between the blocks. The warden’s dwelling, which in
the Eastern Penitentiary had been erected on the circumference
of the radii, at a distance from the centre of supervision,
(because of an original intention to have eight blocks of cells,
instead of seven,) was fixed in its more suitable relative position.
These changes, however, some of which were recommended
by Mr. H. himself to the foreign commissioners who
visited us,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> do not diminish the weight due to the fact, that
upon the construction of the Eastern Penitentiary, there was a
sudden change of model; and that that establishment was the
type of the new form, as respects essential features.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the pride reasonably inspired by the flattering
evidence of his success, it is one of the most creditable reminiscences
connected with the professional career of Mr. H., that
instead of resting upon what he had accomplished, instead of reluctantly
yielding to the evidence of progress in Europe, he was
prompt to seek and to employ in his own later designs, whatever
new details he found to be sufficiently recommended by
theoretical or experimental evidence. The funds at his disposal
for the erection of county jails, were not adequate to the
most perfect elaboration of his own, or other conceptions; but
it may be seen that when called upon, as he was not long after
the completion of the Dauphin county prison, to build one with
forty cells for the county of Berks, in Pennsylvania; he availed
himself of the opportunity to introduce some of the most recent
conveniences of arrangement. In Lancaster county, where his
services were next required, he exhibited the same professional
interest. The prison of this county had not been long occupied,
when he was summoned from his career of public usefulness.
He died suddenly at his residence in Philadelphia, on
the 28th day of March last.</p>

<p>We have, though necessarily in a brief and imperfect manner,
adverted to the peculiar claims of Mr. Haviland, to the
grateful recollection of every friend of the separate discipline;
because in the progress of events, it may have happened that
some of our readers have lost sight of that record of the “early
and bad state,” which is requisite to judge rightly of his merits
as the leader towards the present “improved state” of prison
construction. Those who shall hereafter witness signal triumphs
of benevolence and skill, to which his labors have opened
the way, may&mdash;and if the fortune which has awaited even the
most eminent of reformers shall not be reversed, probably will&mdash;fail
to conceive the full measure of his contributions towards the
crowning result; but while a tradition survives amongst his
associates in prison reform, and their successors in Pennsylvania,
his name will not cease to be mentioned with honorable
distinction.</p>

<p>Amongst the memorials which he has left in other departments
of his art, we might refer to the United States Naval
Hospital at Norfolk, Virginia; and the Pennsylvania State Lunatic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
Asylum, recently finished at the capital of this State; both
of which institutions manifest in a high degree the industrious
preparation, the sound judgment, the economy, and the practical
skill, which he employed upon his designs. Regarding his
function as that of an exponent of the knowledge which enlightened
observation had gathered from experience, his first
step was to acquaint himself with the best conceptions of those
for whom he was to interpret by physical structure; and he
wrought with fidelity to express those conceptions by the most
fitting external fabric; but our limits compel us to abstain from
a notice of these and similar works.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it must be added, that while witnessing the
establishment of his reputation, in a manner rarely exampled
in the history of his profession in modern times, especially
where the object has not been to minister to the wonder and
delight of the multitude, Mr. Haviland maintained a singular
modesty of deportment and of speech, even amongst those who
knew most intimately the interest which his success had excited
in his own bosom. He was frank and amiable in his intercourse,
and liberal in the instruction of those who sought his
advice upon the important subject of his principal thoughts.
He has left to his survivors and to posterity the example of an
unpretending, but eminently useful career.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the Philadelphia Prison Society, held soon
after his decease, the President, in appropriate terms, announced
the decease of Mr. Haviland; and the following resolutions
were unanimously adopted, and ordered to be printed in the
Society’s Journal.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the members of the society have learned, with
sincere regret, the loss of their late fellow-laborer, John Haviland,
whose efforts to develop the architecture of the separate
system of imprisonment, have contributed greatly to its convenient
administration in Pennsylvania, and to the establishment
of the principal features of its methods of construction in other
parts of the world in which it has been introduced.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the society desire to record their appreciation
of the zeal and fidelity with which their deceased friend sought
to promote by suitable architectural means, those enlightened
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
and humane opinions upon which the separate system is founded;
as well as to introduce where the opportunity was afforded to
him, for its better administration, whatever improvements were
suggested by experience, whether at home or abroad.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the President be requested to communicate
to the family of the deceased, the sincere and respectful sympathy
felt by the members of the society, in relation to the recent
bereavement.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="Art_II_THE_PENNSYLVANIA_SYSTEMmdashDR_GIVENS_REPORT"><span class="smcap">Art. II.</span>&mdash;THE PENNSYLVANIA SYSTEM.&mdash;DR. GIVEN’S REPORT.</h2>

<p>Notwithstanding the simplicity and unity of the principle on
which the Pennsylvania system of prison discipline is based,
there is often a vagueness of opinion and a looseness of expression
concerning it that surprises us. What is the principle?
It is <small>CONVICT-SEPARATION</small>&mdash;neither more nor less. We
hold, with the inspectors of the English prisons, that “the separation
of one prisoner from another is the only sound basis
on which a reformatory prison discipline can be established
with any reasonable hope of success.” We believe the reformation
of prisoners can be, and in very many instances has
been, accomplished <i>in consequence of such a separation</i>, which
would not have been, and could not be accomplished without it.</p>

<p>Some persons have no faith in the reformation of convicts,
under any process. With such the only inquiry is for the
cheapest method of imprisonment, without reference to moral
or physical consequences. Some are very credulous, and look
upon the worst rogues as quite reclaimable under the influence
of personal kindness and Christian counsel. We apprehend that
if the probability of prison-reformation may not be determined
precisely by the degree to which the offender is separated from
criminal associations and suggestions, it depends mainly upon
it. And it is our deliberate and long-settled conviction, that
(other things being equal) the best appointed system of discipline
will be of very little avail in its reformatory power, where
convict-association, in any form or degree, is tolerated. This
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
is not a partisan opinion. It has been entertained and expressed
by many who are by no means committed to the separate system,
as such. There is an obvious fitness in the idea, which can
neither be gainsayed nor resisted.</p>

<p>We have said that the fundamental doctrine of the Pennsylvania
system of prison discipline is embodied in one compound
word&mdash;<small>CONVICT-SEPARATION</small>.&mdash;How can we conceive of a “<i>modification</i>”
of this elementary principle? It must be adopted as a
whole or rejected as a whole. The structure of the building, in
which the separate principle is carried out, may be modified.
The method of proceeding in the institution, as it respects instruction,
whether in letters or trades, or as it respects privations,
indulgencies and punishments may be modified. The
cells, the occupations, the diet, the mode of heating and ventilating,
&amp;c., may all be modified, but the principle of separating
the convicts one from the other, is, or it is not, the basis of the
system. It is not susceptible of modification. If separation is
the principle, it is one thing,&mdash;if association is the principle, it
is another thing.&mdash;The <i>degree</i> of association or of separation, is
not involved.</p>

<p>When, therefore, we are told of “a necessity for modifying,
to a certain extent, the Pennsylvania system, by allowing a
certain class of convicts to be associated” for any purpose, or
for any period of time, the phraseology is open to misapprehension
at least, if not to animadversion.</p>

<p>The phrase “<i>modifying</i> to a certain extent” is doubtless inadvertently
used in such cases for the phrase “<i>abandoning</i> to a
certain extent.” Words are significant of ideas, and ambiguity
in the former, necessarily leads to ambiguity in the latter. If
we speak of the associate system, as “modified” by the occasional
separation of a stubborn class of convicts, or of the separate
system, as modified by the occasional association of an
imbecile class, we soon confound association and separation, and
actually have neither the one nor the other. We apprehend that
this is the very position to which some of the opposers of convict-separation
would not be unwilling to see it brought. Indeed,
some who profess to be staunch advocates of separation, have
conceded (inconsiderately, as we think) that each plan has its
own advantages, and that the best system would be the product
of a combination.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span></p>

<p>As at present advised we cannot consent to this view. Few
evils arise, under any system of government, for which there
is not a choice of remedies; and if it is made evident that under
the application of a sound principle of prison-discipline,
cases occur in which the legitimate ends of punishment are
defeated, or at least not answered, the first question would be
whether these cases are numerous and important enough to
impair our confidence in the principle; or whether the exceptions
are not necessarily incident to any general system, and
such as cannot be provided against; or whether the remedy, if
practicable at all, may not be applied without any infringement
of the general principle. A compromise between two methods
of convict management, so radically and essentially diverse as
separation and association, seems to us entirely fanciful.</p>

<p>These general observations must serve to introduce a very
brief notice of the Report of the Physician of the Eastern
State Penitentiary for the six months ending July 1, 1851.
That day closed seven years of laborious and faithful service
by Dr. Given in this important institution. His reports, during
that period, have been frequently noticed in the pages of our
Journal, and have contributed essentially, not only to the improvement
of the particular institution under his care, but to
the general interests of humanity. Few if any documents of
this class, embody a larger amount of valuable information, or
are entitled to more consideration.</p>

<p>The author not being prepared to serve the interests of a
party or a clique, nor to defend a favorite theory, his reports
have uniformly taken independent ground, and must be regarded
as the honest record of the results of professional experience
and observation.</p>

<p>We understand the present and final report of Dr. G., as unequivocally
and emphatically favorable to <i>convict-separation</i>.
That there are some prisoners on whom it bears with peculiar
severity is a matter of course. No species of punishment is
exempt from such inequalities. They are less prevalent,
however, under the separate discipline than under any other,
from the very fact that the isolation of the prisoner from his
fellows, allows us to vary the minuter conditions of the discipline
in peculiar cases, without exciting murmuring and discontent
among less favored parties. That a relaxation of rigid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
discipline in an individual case, no matter how peculiar, if it
becomes notorious works wide-spread mischief, is fully shown
in the experience of the English prisons.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>We do not understand Dr. Given to maintain that the
class of convicts, whose mental weakness unfits them for the
discipline of separation, would be any better off in a congregate
prison, unless they were allowed “to converse with hardly
any restriction.” So that we are left to conclude, that some
peculiar method of treatment, embraced in neither of the prevailing
systems must be devised to suit the specific case of
weak-minded culprits, in a separate prison, or we must expect
them to become deranged. Now we humbly conceive, that
the remedy for the supposed grievance in such cases is in the
hands of the court, and should be applied in the terms of the
sentence, and not in the process of its execution. The mental
vigor of a culprit is as legitimately a subject of investigation,
as his moral habits and physical constitution. If he borders on
that state of imbecility which would exempt him from moral
responsibility, the shade of guilt in which he is involved will be
scarcely perceptible, and the punishment would of course be
proportionably light. If on the other hand, the character and
method of his crime indicate ingenuity in contriving and vigor
in executing his criminal purposes, though he may be below par
in his intellectual capacity, he must take his chance with other
offenders, who may be better able to endure the retribution
than himself. It is so all the world over. The punishment
which many sins carry in themselves, does not adapt itself very
nicely to individual constitutions and temperaments. One slave
of the intoxicating cup may have far greater powers of resisting
the temptation to indulgence than his comrade, yet they are
found wallowing in the same gutter. Men of limited capacity
have a much harder struggle for their daily bread than their
more capable neighbors, but in the event of their feloniously
taking what does not belong to them, we do not find special
laws are enacted to meet their case. So in families, schools, and
larger communities, general laws are established which operate
unequally, but are on the whole salutary and wise; and so must
it be in the discipline of every prison. The same degree of restraint,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
privation or punishment bears much more severely on
some than on others, and while humanity requires us to alleviate,
as far as possible, the miseries of public prisons, it can
hardly expect us to forego the eminent advantages of a system
of discipline, because it does not adapt itself to every grade of
intellect and education. No part of the machinery of civil
government is capable of such a nice adjustment.</p>

<p>But assuming that provision should be made for the necessities
of convicts, who lack ordinary mental vigor, and whose
condition is easily detected by an experienced observer, we
have the unqualified testimony of Dr. G., that with such provision,
the Pennsylvanian system intelligently administered for
moderate periods is entirely safe for mind and body. This
opinion, after seven successive years of close, daily observation,
by a resident physician, is certainly very conclusive. As
to the phrase, “moderate periods,” it is well known that our
Journal has uniformly advocated a reduction in the terms of
imprisonment for by far the larger portion of crimes,&mdash;connected
however with efficient checks upon the pardoning power.</p>

<p>But Dr. G. finds among the convicts of the Eastern State
Penitentiary, as he would find in any other similar prison, “a
certain proportion who have not sufficient mental vigor to resist
the enervating tendencies of the discipline.” Upon examining
the report for a more particular description of the class,
he had in view, we find, that “in many of them the mental deficiency
is so slight, as hardly to challenge casual observation,
or to prevent them from following successfully the ordinary
pursuits of life.” Dr. G. would not, therefore, exempt these
persons from responsibility for their crimes. But how shall
they be treated in a separate prison? What is needful to “enable
them to resist the enervating tendencies of the discipline,”
or in other words, how, in administering the discipline, shall
we provide for that lack of mental vigor which exposes them
to suffer under it? Dr. G. replies, “By sufficient social intercourse
with qualified officers to preserve the natural strength
of their minds.” Is this better than “associating them in workshops
during the day under vigilant supervision, as in congregate
prisons?” Dr. G. replies, “Yes, infinitely preferable.”
Why then is not this simple counteracting agency employed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
wherever the evil is supposed to exist? Dr. G. replies, “The expense
of such an arrangement will, I fear, render it impossible.”
And what is the expense? The report does not furnish
any estimate, nor have we the means of forming one. But
of one thing we feel confident, viz., that if the addition
to the corps of officers of one or two men of suitable qualifications
for the purpose, would be the means of perfecting the
system of punishment, or of securing, in a higher degree, the
humane purposes of the government in inflicting it, it will not
be withheld. We should be slow to believe such a measure would
fail, for so paltry a consideration as one or two thousand dollars
a year, which would be the outside of the expense.</p>

<p>Suppose it were clearly the duty and interest of the government
(and its duty is always its interest, as it is that of individuals) to
provide for the unfortunate class of convicts to which Dr. G. refers,
it would become a question how far it would be needful to
abridge the average term of imprisonment at present suffered, in
order to avoid the mischief which his report discloses. For it
will be observed, that there is quite a difference of opinion as to
the time within which the supposed injurious effects of seclusion
are developed. Even the opponents of separation have generally
regarded a sentence of from twelve to eighteen months as
entirely safe. Dr. G. very properly considers the age of the
convict as entitled to much consideration in determining the
period of his confinement; and we should be quite disposed, at
first, to fall in with his opinion, that “unless for the gravest
offences, the sentence of minors should seldom exceed a single
year;” and yet when we look around us and observe the boldness,
the ingenuity and the malignity which often characterize
the criminal acts of minors in our times, we can scarcely persuade
ourselves that extraordinary lenity could be safely shown
to them. A severer discipline in an institution that should receive
them at an earlier stage of their career, might often check their
criminal propensities, and put them upon a praiseworthy course;
but when they become reckless of life, and property, and public
peace, and boast themselves in feats of iniquity which matured
convicts would scarcely attempt to excel, we should be slow to
relax the rigour of punishment, except in cases of manifest infirmity
of body or mind.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In the second year of imprisonment, the bodily and mental
vigor of convicts generally begins to decline, though they may
struggle on for an indefinite period, without having any actual
disease developed. In all cases, but more especially when the
sentences range between two and ten years, the prisoner should
be closely watched; and when the slightest symptom of failing
strength appears, he should be immediately put to some outdoor
employment, and there kept until his health would be re-established,
when he could be again returned to his cell. If
this principle would be strictly acted upon, it would render the
longest sentence comparatively harmless.”</p></blockquote>

<p>We are gratified with such clear and unequivocal testimony
to the safety of convict-separation; for we look upon the resort
to out-of-door exercise, in special cases, as so perfectly practicable
and so entirely in keeping with the principle of the
system, that we could scarcely reckon it as a condition or exception.
It is of the same character with a precaution respecting
air, apparel, bathing, &amp;c. Indeed we do not suppose
Dr. G. himself has a particle of doubt, that all needful out-of-door
exercise can be given to every convict whose health
requires it, as easily and as consistently with the most rigid
separation as an extra blanket, or a new article of diet.</p>

<p>It will be observed that in the extract just made from Dr.
G.’s report, the <i>second</i> year of imprisonment is designated as
that in which the bodily and mental vigor of convicts generally
begins to decline, and he also mentions those whose sentences
range from two to ten years, as “requiring to be closely watched.”
From which we infer, that in his opinion there is little
danger to be apprehended from the <i>first</i> year’s seclusion;
that in the <i>second</i> year there is no danger to be apprehended
to the great mass of prisoners, but only to those who have “not
sufficient mental vigor to resist the enervating tendencies of the
discipline,” and who generally begin at that period to decline
in body and mind; and as to convicts whose “sentences range
from two to ten years, they should be closely watched,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>Our general impression of the weight of authority on this
subject, at home and abroad, would coincide with the opinion
here expressed; but upon turning to the fable which is annexed
to Dr. G.’s report we find, to our surprise, that in seven of the
eight insane cases of 1851, the average period of prison-life at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
which the disorder appeared, was less than eight months; viz.,
one at four months, one at five, one at seven, one at eight, two
at ten, and one at eleven months. In the eighth case the development
of disease was postponed for three years and more!
Only two of the eight were minors; five were whites, two
mulattoes, and one black.</p>

<p>We need not question at all the soundness of Dr. G.’s opinion,
nor the correctness of his facts. The conclusion to which they
unite in constraining us however, is that the cause of insanity
is not well-assigned. It is quite possible that the present condition
of the prisoner, with all its antecedent anxiety and excitement
and its prospective severity, combine to disclose, or
give form and definiteness to a morbid condition of mind or
body or both, which might not have occurred at all had he
escaped detection or conviction; or which might not have
taken that specific form under a different system of discipline;
or which might be corrected by seasonable and judicious attention.
That symptoms of a deranged state were discoverable
so soon after commitment, and without any peculiarly exciting
cause, seems to forbid the idea of attributing it wholly or chiefly
to a denial of convict-association. And we apprehend, that if
those very cases were at once transferred to Auburn or Sing-Sing,
without the slightest change in their mental or bodily state,
the parties would take their places at once in the shop-gang, and
render their master-contractor as good an account of a day’s
work as any of their comrades! They would be just as insane
there, as in the Eastern State Penitentiary, but their eccentricities
would not be likely to receive special investigation or care,
and hence would never be reported as insane cases. The reports
from congregate prisons fully warrant this position.</p>

<p>The careful reader of Dr. Given’s report cannot fail to see
that his humane and honorable sympathies have led him, as we
have already intimated, to overlook the inevitable necessity of
inequalities in the operation of general laws. If he says, “we
can rest satisfied to restrict the application of our system to
those to whom it is applicable, I believe there will be quite as
little insanity among them as if they were associated.” But to
whom is it applicable? To all, except those whose mental
character renders it unsafe to subject them to it. How many
of this class are there? Why it is so small as to “admit of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
most accurate supervision,” so that “the corrupting influences
of association,” (if adopted,) “will be materially diminished.”
But what is the number in units, tens or hundreds? Why last
year it was eight in an aggregate of four hundred and forty-six!
And may we regard this as the “certain proportion of convicts,
who have not sufficient mental vigor to resist the enervating
tendencies of our system?” Eight in four hundred and forty-six!</p>

<p>Of this class of convicts, more or less, it is said, that “an experienced
observer will readily detect many of them on the day
of their reception, and a few weeks’ observation will generally
suffice for the discovery of the remainder.” If we bring this remark
to bear on the eight cases of last year, we shall be compelled
to circumscribe its application considerably. Two of them
“were decidedly insane when received.” Of the remaining
six, “one a mulatto, had been once or oftener insane before imprisonment;”
his mother had also been insane, and he was
syphilitic. Two others were not of the class which we are
considering, for it is expressly stated that they “had not imbecile
minds,” though “both had received a fracture of the skull,
and were thus doubly predisposed to insanity.” Of the three
that are left, one “was not considered actually defective in
mind,” and of course he would not have been put among the
class “who are deficient in mental vigor to resist the enervating
tendencies of the system.” Nevertheless, his mind “was
of such a character, that shortly after his reception, it was predicted
that he would go deranged before the expiration of his
sentence.” What that “character” was we are not told, nor
is it needful for our present purpose to know. Then of the
other two it is expressly said, that they were “considered as
presenting no striking mental peculiarity on admission, either
of strength or weakness.” One of them was three years and
one month in prison, before exhibiting any marks of mental derangement,
and the other ten months. If we do not misunderstand
the report then, not one of the last year’s insane cases
answers to the description of that “certain class of convicts,
who cannot be placed under the usual isolation, without the
greatest risk of insanity supervening.”</p>

<p>Perhaps we construe the language of the report in this connection
too rigidly, for in another section, the “mental deficiency”
of many of these same persons “which an experienced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
observer will readily detect on the day of their reception, or a
few weeks after,” is described as “so slight, as hardly to challenge
casual observation or to prevent their following successfully
the ordinary pursuits of life.” We think it would be very
difficult to modify the discipline of a prison, so as to provide
for such minute diversities of mental power among convicts.
They will have to take their chance with the other rogues, we
fear.</p>

<p>Although Dr. Given in one passage of his report speaks of
“a modification to a certain extent of the Pennsylvania system,”
and “of association in workshops,” and “of associated labor,”
we are happy to find that the general tenor of the document
sanctions no such view. On the contrary, free, vigorous and
timely “out-of-door exercise,” which is perfectly compatible in
any form and degree with the principle of our system, is clearly
in his opinion, the grand panacea for prison-ills. The gardener
and waggoner, at the Eastern State Penitentiary are accustomed
to employ as assistants, such convicts as need exercise
in the open air, and an officer is specially appointed to “attend
invalid convicts, and give to them at least one hour daily of
out-of-door exercise, combined with improving social intercourse.”</p>

<p>It is obvious that these precautionary measures may be
adopted to any needful extent, without any violation of our cardinal
principle. Indeed, we see no evidence in the report before
us, that they have not been employed during the past year, to the
full extent which the exigencies of the institution have required.
Not a case is mentioned or hinted at, in which suffering has been
endured, or danger incurred for want of them. Indeed from the
description which the Doctor gives of the position and treatment
of a convict in our Penitentiary, at the present time, we
can scarcely conceive of a system of penal suffering being administered
with more judgment, care and lenity. In speaking
of a keeper’s interpretation of the nature and responsibility
of his office, Dr. G. says: “Aware of the vast power which his
official position affords for influencing the prisoner, for good or
evil, his physical, his intellectual, and his moral character are
subjected to close scrutiny; and the nature of his work, the
amount exacted of him, the extent and character of his social
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
intercourse are regulated accordingly. If, after due experience,
it is found that the employment of the convict is not adapted
to his strength or capacity, the fact is reported to the warden,
and intelligent suggestions offered as to his future treatment.
If the prisoner’s moral conduct proves perverse, he is subdued
by kind remonstrance, when for similar breaches of discipline
he would formerly have been punished; and if symptoms of insanity,
or physical disease portend, the deepest interest is felt,
and every possible exertion made to avert the threatened evil.”</p>

<p>We know not what more could be asked, if the idea of punishment
is not to be entirely foregone.</p>

<p>Indeed, we cannot avoid the conviction that in one particular
at least, a pernicious indulgence is granted; viz., the use of
tobacco. Dr. G. anticipates “quite as much censure as approbation,”
will be bestowed on this item of treatment, and he
may think himself very fortunate, if the scales are so nearly
equipoised as that. For ourselves, we cannot qualify our
condemnation of the practice on every ground. So far as the
Dr.’s argument rests on strength of habit, it would be equally
cogent for the use of intoxicating liquors; and we must suppose
he speaks ironically, when he refers to “legislative chambers,
halls of justice, or even our pulpits,” as furnishing invariably
safe precedents in moral conduct. Convict-life is, and of right
ought to be a life of privation; and the wise disciplinarian takes
advantage of this period to cross the prisoner’s vicious inclinations
at every point, and thus connect the process of punishment
with the process of reformation. Dr. G. has seen “a strong
stubborn man beg for tobacco with tears in his eyes.” We
have seen such a man beg, in like manner, for a drink of grog,
or the means of escape from prison. But it is “the painfulness
of this privation” which answers, in our prisons, the purpose
which the douche, or the yoke, or the cat-o’-nine tails are supposed
to answer in other prisons. It is suffering with profit, for
it breaks up a most vicious habit, and it is suffering without degradation,
too. Why should we throw away such an advantage?</p>

<p>But what shall we say to the other ground of apology for
allowing tobacco to the prisoners, viz., for the cure of “dyspepsia
and mental depressions, otherwise treated in vain?” In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
such a war, we must put Greek against Greek. In insane
asylums, where physical and mental diseases are supposed to
have the most skilful medical treatment, we are informed that
the use of tobacco is strictly interdicted by the resident physician;
and we notice by the return of the Ohio Lunatic Asylum,
that six of the cases of insanity received into that institution
last year, are believed to have originated in the use of that
narcotic! Nothing could show the prodigious power of the
habit more strikingly than the remark of Dr. G., that “the fear
of being deprived of it has produced a degree of order and discipline
throughout the establishment, that the severest punishment
could not effect.” We have seen, in a nursery of young
rogues, a violent uproar against a parent or care-taker quieted
at once by just giving a sugar plum, or a bit of gingerbread,
which had been at first denied. How far such concessions
to the vicious appetite of convicts, or to the unruly will of
children promote sound discipline, is not a matter of doubt to
observing minds. A firm maintenance of wholesome authority,
or the discreet use of King Solomon’s specific for disorders of
the temper, would perhaps add a new strain to the discordant
music for the time being, but it would be likely to produce very
agreeable harmony in the end.</p>

<p>The striking improvements which have been made in the
hygienic arrangement of the Eastern State Penitentiary, and
for which it is greatly indebted to the earnest and well directed
efforts of Dr. G., cannot fail to impress every reader of the report.
Without relaxing in any degree the radical principle of
separation, or rendering the penal feature of the discipline any
less severe, the moral and physical well being of the convicts
has been greatly advanced, and the claims of the worst of them
to kind and humane treatment have been recognised with a distinctness
of which they are, for the most part, happily conscious.
If we would give to an inquirer on the subject a succinct but
impressive view of the advance which has been made in the
improvement of our system of prison-discipline, we know of no
document to which we would refer with more confidence than
this report of Dr. Given.

<h2 id="Art_III_JUVENILE_DELINQUENCY_TRUANCY_ampc"><span class="smcap">Art. III.</span>&mdash;JUVENILE DELINQUENCY, TRUANCY, &amp;c.</h2>

<p>In our last number, we commenced a notice of several interesting
matters occurring in Boston and its vicinity, and falling
within the range of our observation. The presentment of the
Grand Jury of Suffolk County was under discussion, and we
promised to return to it again when opportunity should allow,
and this promise we now redeem.</p>

<p>The establishment of “an <i>intermediate reform school</i> for
young persons, who are committed for first offences, when there
is an apparent opportunity for their reformation by the use of
moral and intellectual discipline,” is strongly urged in the presentment.
The Grand Jury have in view a plan, “where the mark
of the penitentiary shall not be put upon the convicts, but where,
by judicious management on the part of superintendent, and
exemplary conduct on the part of those consigned to his charge&mdash;they
whose misfortune it may be to stray from the paths of
rectitude, could again be received into the bosom of society
without reproach.”</p>

<p>To enforce their suggestions, they call into view “the large
number of minors that have been brought before the tribunals
of public justice within the six months last past,” and express
their deep conviction that “if some plan were provided, at which
neglected children could be made to pass their time, instead of
upon the wharves, in the streets, around the doors of theatres,
or in the market places,&mdash;say in some industrial school provided
by the State,&mdash;juvenile delinquency would very much decrease.”</p>

<p>These are all very good notions for a Boston jury, or any
other jury to entertain, but suppose we should transform all
these jurymen into Legislators, and give them a seat in the
House of Representatives; and suppose a proposition were submitted
to enact a law, making it compulsory on all parents to
give their children a certain amount of schooling every year,
and in default thereof, authorizing and requiring the proper
authorities to remove such children from the custody of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
parents, for the purpose of schooling them. Would they then
and there take the same view of the subject? Would no misgivings
arise about the bearing which their advocacy of such
a stringent law might have on their political prospects? Would
they advance as directly and as boldly to the application of the
remedy as they do to the exposure of the evil?</p>

<p>It is obvious from the language of the report, that the Suffolk
Grand Jury have a much clearer idea of the disease than they
have of the cure. The class of persons to whom they refer
as “committed for first offences” are nevertheless “convicts,”
and nothing can remove the “mark of the penitentiary” but an
executive pardon. And whether there is “an apparent opportunity
for their reformation,” is not an easy question to determine.
When the distinction comes to be practically applied,
it would be found very perplexing. Our Houses of Refuge are
intended to receive those who have entered, or are just entering
upon a course of life, which ordinarily ends in the penitentiary;
and they have doubtless saved scores of youth from the convict’s
infamous doom, and returned them to their families and to society,
with every prospect of usefulness and respectability. And we
had supposed that the State Reform School at Westborough,
which has been so successfully conducted, was designed to
answer exactly this end. The boys who are committed there,
are generally sent for first offences, and the discipline is strictly
reformatory. Does the report of the jury then contemplate an
institution between the Reform School and the State Penitentiary,
or between the Reform School and “the House of Reformation
for Juvenile Offenders,” at South Boston? If the former,
what ends are expected to be answered, which the institution
at Westborough fails to accomplish; and if the latter, what
class of offenders would they find between those at Westborough
and those at South Boston, for whose case neither of these
establishments provides?</p>

<p>However obscure the intimations of the report may be on
this point, they are very clear on another, viz., that juvenile
delinquency would be greatly diminished if all idle, loitering, loafing
children “about town” were put to good, industrial schools.
It is not a whit more certain, that if the Cochituate pond were
to dry up suddenly, Boston would have a far less generous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
supply of water than it has now. But how shall this abstraction
from the streets and wharves, of the filthy, foul-mouthed,
ragged urchins be brought about? When and where shall the industrial
school be established? What shall be the nature of the
discipline, and the length of the confinement? Shall the public
support them, or shall contributions be levied on negligent
parents? Such schools have been greatly prospered, we know,
in some of the chief towns of England and Scotland; but the
institutions of society and indeed its whole structure, will allow
that to be done there, which would not be tolerated here. We
must give our Boston friends credit, however, for a very wise
and effective step towards the suppression of juvenile vice. We
allude to the law for the correction of truancy, and we cannot
more usefully occupy a page of our limited space than by
transcribing one or two passages from a leading document on
the subject. The views expressed are quite as appropriate to
Philadelphia as to Boston.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>As early as 1846, a report came from the school committee of
the city, in which the mischief of truancy is represented as not
only interfering greatly with the regular process of instruction,
but as exerting a demoralising effect which can hardly be counteracted,
and employs much of the time and energy of the masters
in preserving the discipline which it assails. Nor is it an evil
(says the report) which ends with the schools. If it did, our
duty would still require of us to do whatever we can do for its
suppression or diminution. But it is certain, that, from the
juvenile depravity of which the truancy of the school is both a
sign and a cause, grows a large part of the suffering and crime
of society. It is rare to find in our prisons those who were
well cared for as children, and trained in regular habits of useful
industry. An active child can be kept out of evil only by
giving him something good to do; and when idleness has
thoroughly corrupted the earliest years of life, what can we expect
from riper years, but a maturity of vice, greater as temptations
become stronger, and opportunities for crime are
enlarged?</p>

<p>In the worst cases, the truancy of the children, or their entire
absence from school, is permitted by the parents, and sometimes
caused by their desire to share in those wretched gains
of debasing or dishonest pursuits, for which after-time will
exact a fearful price.</p>

<p>If the law on the one hand, provides schools to which all the
children of this city <i>may</i> go, on the other it provides another
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
institution to which certain children may be <i>made to go</i>. Here
then are institutions for those who <i>will</i>, and for those who <i>will
not</i> be instructed; and under one or other of these classes all
our children may be arranged. The 143d chapter of the Revised
Statutes, Sect. 5th, enumerates among those who may
be sent to the House of Correction, “stubborn children;” and
the “Act concerning juvenile offenders in the City of Boston,”
authorizes the City Council to establish a building for “the reception,
instruction, employment and reformation of such juvenile
offenders as are hereinafter named;” this building we have:
and the third section of the same Act provides, “That any Justice
or Judge of the said Courts, (the Supreme Court, Municipal
Court, and Police Courts) on the application of the Mayor, or
of any Aldermen of the City of Boston, or of any Director of
the House of Industry, or House of Reformation, or of any
Overseer of the Poor, of said City, shall have power to sentence
to said house of employment and reformation, all children who
live an idle and dissolute life, whose parents are dead, or if living,
from drunkenness, or other vices, neglect to provide any
suitable employment, or exercise any salutary control over said
children.” And the sixth section provides that any child committed
to the House of Correction, may be transferred to the
House of Employment and Reformation.”</p>

<p>It would seem, therefore, that the framers of the laws have
done enough, if they who are entrusted with the execution of
the laws do their duty.</p></blockquote>

<p>These statements and views were not without their effect,
though measures of reform were not matured until 1850, when
a law was past, which we copy entire as the shortest method
of presenting the whole matter to the view of our readers.</p>

<h3>“AN ACT CONCERNING TRUANT CHILDREN AND ABSENTEES
FROM SCHOOL.”</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>1. Each of the several cities and towns in this Commonwealth,
is authorized and empowered to make all needful provisions
and arrangements concerning habitual truants and
children not attending school, without any regular and lawful
occupation, growing up in ignorance, between the ages of six
and fifteen years; and also, all such ordinances and by-laws
respecting such children, as shall be deemed most conducive to
their welfare, and the good order of such city or town; and
there shall be annexed to such ordinances, suitable penalties,
not exceeding for any one breach, a fine of twenty dollars:
<i>provided</i>, that said ordinances and by-laws shall be approved
by the Court of Common Pleas for the county, and shall not be
repugnant to laws of the commonwealth.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

<p>2. The several cities and towns, availing themselves of the
provisions of this act, shall appoint, at the annual meetings of
said towns, or annually by the mayor and aldermen of said
cities, three or more persons, who alone shall be authorized to
make the complaints, in every case of violation of said ordinances
or by-laws, to the justice of the peace, or other judicial
officer, who, by said ordinances, shall have jurisdiction in the
matter, which persons, thus appointed, shall have authority to
carry into execution the judgments of said justices of the peace,
or other judicial officer.</p>

<p>3. The said justices of the peace, or other judicial officers,
shall, in all cases, at their discretion, in place of the fine aforesaid,
be authorized to order children, proved before them to be
growing up in truancy, and without the benefit of the education
provided for them by law, to be placed, for such periods of
time as they may judge expedient, in such institution of instruction
or house of reformation, or other suitable situation, as may
be assigned or provided for the purpose, under the authority
conveyed by the first section, in each city or town availing itself
of the powers herein granted.</p></blockquote>

<h3>ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF BOSTON.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Sect. 1.</i> The city of Boston hereby adopts the two hundred
and ninety-fourth chapter of the laws of the commonwealth, for
the year one thousand eight hundred and fifty, entitled “an act
concerning truant children and absentees from school,” and
avails itself of the provisions of the same.</p>

<p><i>Sect. 2.</i> Any of the persons described in the first section of
said act, upon conviction of any offence therein described, shall
be punished by a fine not exceeding twenty dollars; and the
senior justice, by appointment of the police court, shall have
jurisdiction of the offences set forth in said act.</p>

<p><i>Sect. 3.</i> The house for the employment and reformation of
juvenile offenders, is hereby assigned and provided as the institution
of instruction, house of reformation, or suitable situation,
mentioned in the third section of said act.</p></blockquote>

<p>We understand that this wholesome law was put in active operation
at once in the city of Boston and in the adjoining town
of Roxbury, and that a faithful execution of it bids fair to correct
the hideous public nuisance of truant children. We wish it
were practicable to secure similar legislation in our city. No
indolent, thoughtless farmer ever stood on the borders of his
field, and witnessed the broad-cast dispersion of Canada thistle-down
over every part of it, with more composure than our lawmakers
and magistracy look upon the spread of juvenile corruption
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
in Philadelphia. We say this not without a grateful
sense of the late liberality of the legislature in granting $60,000
towards the erection of a new Refuge in Philadelphia; nor without
a just appreciation of the results of the labours of that excellent
institution; nor without taking into view the various agencies
designed to accomplish similar objects. But upon the mass
of juvenile waywardness and depravity, they seem scarcely to
have made a perceptible impression. The accumulation of
the material out of which convicts are made is not sensibly
checked. The sources of this corruption have been laid open
to view in the reports of our Houses of Refuge, our Magdalen
Asylums and police reports, but they remain as numerous and as
prolific as ever. Corrupt places of amusement are thronged by
boys and girls. Our eligible schools are open to them in vain.
The hawking of newspapers, occasional jobs at the steamboat
wharves or depots and chance-errands in the market-place,
afford them means of vicious indulgence; and the regular service
of an apprenticeship to some useful business, with the wholesome
restraints which were formerly involved in this relation, are
too irksome for their impatient spirits. Boys and girls of twelve
or fifteen years of age, in a majority of cases, choose their own
pursuits, receive the whole or a part of their earnings, to be
expended at their pleasure; and with these elements of independence
it is not difficult to connect a contempt for all authority,
parental and magisterial, and this soon breaks up the
foundations of society. Then there is that still unabated nuisance
of young girls going about with fruit and candy; and by
their very manner of life exciting, if not soliciting heartless
wretches to make them their frequent or future prey. Is our
community doomed to stand quietly by and see these streams
of social corruption rising and swelling? Is there no arm long
enough and strong enough to reach the fountain and check, if
not suppress, its issues?</p>

<p>We have given so much space to this topic of the report,
that we must be satisfied with but a brief notice of the rest.</p>

<p>The State Prison at Charlestown, of which <i>Henry K. Frothingham</i>
is warden, contains 476 prisoners, one-third of whom
are foreigners. Six deaths occurred during the year, and the
average number on the sick list was six. Libraries are highly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
commended as a means of moral culture, and it is recommended
that they be furnished at the expense of the Commonwealth, not
only to the State prison, but to county gaols and houses of
correction.</p>

<p>The stinted supply of water at the Charlestown prison is
mentioned as an evil, and it is a very expensive one too, inasmuch
as it was procured during part of the summer, at an expense
of from two to five dollars a day!</p>

<p>In the county gaol there were received between November
1, 1850, and November 1, 1851, 5,541 prisoners, of both sexes,
3,135 of whom were foreigners. The daily average was 120.
The Grand Jury think that the Commonwealth’s witnesses
should receive as good fare while in prison, as they would be
likely to receive at home. Whereas, they now are served
with the same food that convicts receive. Whether this is not
quite as good as most honest poor men can afford, does not
appear.</p>

<p>In the Alms House at Deer Island during the six months
ending December 1, 1851, 931 paupers were received, of
whom 686 were foreigners. Of the whole number, 33 were
males, and 398 females, and 203 were under 12 years of age.
The number of deaths in the same period was 77. There is a
loud complaint here also, that the supply of water is inadequate.
No trifling defect in such an establishment.</p>

<p>The Grand Jury advert to the intolerable nuisance of bawdy
houses, and suggest the expediency of a law, making the owners
of such houses responsible for the use which is made of
their premises. There is also a distinct reference in the report
to the great disparity of punishments for similar offences, and
the evil consequences which attend it&mdash;a subject to which we
have more than once invited and urged attention.</p>

<p>The erection of the new County Jail in Boston, is such an
important movement in the prison-world, and the structure and
occupants present so many interesting topics of remark, that
we must make it the subject of a distinct article.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span></p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="Art_IV_INSANE_CONVICTS"><span class="smcap">Art. IV.</span>&mdash;INSANE CONVICTS.</h2>

<p>We cannot refrain from calling the attention of our readers
to the continued postponement of measures for the safe custody
and proper treatment of insane convicts. In the last report
(January 1, 1852,) of the inspectors of the Eastern State Penitentiary,
the following passage occurs:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If mental alienation in a prisoner renders his enlargement
in society dangerous to its peace and safety, then that imprisonment
is best which partakes of the nature rather of restraint,
than punishment. There are in the Penitentiary some prisoners
who, insane on admission, require now only restraints and
proper treatment for their mental disease.</p>

<p>With these views, the Board of Inspectors would respectfully
suggest that the legislature would provide by law for the removal
of such cases to the State Lunatic Asylum. In that institution,
established for the treatment of mental disease, the
prisoner who ought from prudential reasons, to be restrained
from society, could be subjected to remedial discipline, if not
cure.</p></blockquote>

<p>By the report of the warden it would appear, that he has no
expectation of more than a partial relief from this quarter.
His language is:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>By information derived from the public prints and other
sources, the State Asylum at Harrisburg would appear to be
designed as a hospital for the cure of the insane, to the exclusion
of the <i>hopeless</i> sufferers from this distressing malady, who
may offend against the laws: thereby leaving us still to be the
recipients and guardians of these unhappy people.</p>

<p>If such be the case, I would earnestly inquire whether the
subject should not be at once so understood, and suitable
arrangements for their comfort and security be immediately
made, under the sanction of legislative aid and authority.</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the physicians in allusion to this topic, calls attention
to the fact that “much of the mortality is composed of
prisoners, who, first go deranged, and then, like Bajazet, literally
dash out their brains against the bars of their cage.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>When will this terrible cruelty end? he asks. I had hoped that
the remedy was at hand, but I regret to learn that the prospect of
transferring our insane to the Stale Asylum seems as yet far distant.
In their behalf, however, I shall make a last appeal. In
the name of justice and mercy, let it be no longer necessary for
the friends of the institution to deplore, or in the power of its
opponents to boast that a number of helpless lunatics are immured
within the cells of the Eastern Penitentiary.</p></blockquote>

<p>And the other dilates upon the subject in the following terms:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>For many years past, I find representations have been
made to the Board by my predecessors, urging the propriety
and the necessity almost, of removing the insane confined in
this institution. I must record my testimony also.&mdash;The evil is
unabated, and I cannot consistently with my duty as physician,
nor with my own personal feelings, pass by this matter without
at least doing the little I may be able to have it remedied.
Heretofore there have been difficulties in the way, which happily
exist no longer. The completion of a State Lunatic
Asylum, it is to be hoped, has removed the last obstacle to a
course already long approved of by every one, and urgently
demanded by all the material and moral circumstances concerned
in the case. For the object of prisons, if I understand
it, is the punishment and prevention of crime, and, possibly the
reformation of criminals. But the mischief that irresponsibles
may do, is not crime, nor are they criminals: they may be restrained,
but not punished. We punish and endeavor to reform
the criminal, the imbecile and insane, we confine sometimes,
but at all times, should endeavor to protect, to foster, to cure.
It may often be very proper, in regard to these, to turn their
hospital into a temporary prison, but it can hardly be deemed
compatible with the objects and discipline, or the material
arrangements and accommodations of penitentiaries, to make
them serve the double purpose of prison and hospital&mdash;confounding
in a common receptacle those that society ought to
protect, and those it is obliged to punish.</p>

<p>At the present time, we have a number of these unfortunates
in a truly pitiable condition; and it is not only with a
painful, but also with a mortifying and humiliating feeling, that
we are continually obliged to reflect, that it is not in our power
to improve it.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span></p>

<p>Turning from the State Penitentiary to the State Hospital,
we are met with the following passage in the first annual report
of the trustees:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“There are at the present time in the State penitentiaries,
and in the different jails of the commonwealth, a considerable
number of insane,&mdash;alleged criminals&mdash;who ought to be transferred
to the State hospital as soon as its buildings are completed.
There are also in these institutions a few, who, from
their peculiarly dangerous character, and the utter hopelessness
of benefiting them by treatment, can never with propriety become
inmates of the hospital. To protect the community and
the ordinary insane from the dangerous propensities of these individuals,
it would be necessary to introduce into our wards,
intended for the treatment of disease, all the most repulsive
features of a prison, or that a separate building, having strictly
a prison character, should be erected upon the grounds. Some
legislation will be required before any of these cases can be
admitted, and some mode of proceeding should be adopted which
will prevent any but proper cases being received from these
sources.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It is obvious that different constructions are put upon the
language of the report of the trustees, by the different officers of
the penitentiary. The inspectors evidently regard the State
Lunatic Asylum as the proper place to which insane prisoners
should be removed, whether for safe keeping or for treatment.
The warden apprehends, that one class of the insane convicts
would be received at the State Hospital, though the other may
be excluded. Dr. Given regards the prospect of transferring
any of them as far distant, while Dr. Lassiter thinks the completion
of the hospital has disposed of the last obstacle to the
removal of all.</p>

<p>If we understand the language of the trustees, it admits that
a considerable number of “ordinarily” insane persons now in
our State Penitentiary and in the different jails, ought to be
transferred to the hospital as soon as it is so far completed as to
secure them; while they maintain that there is another class of
insane prisoners of “dangerous propensities,” who ought not to
be received into any hospital, but for whom a separate building
should be provided, on the grounds belonging to the State institution,
entirely distinct from it, though doubtless under the
same supervision and attendance with the main hospital.</p>

<p>In giving this construction to the passage, we assume that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
the phrase “<i>any of these cases</i>” in the last clause, is limited to
the dangerous and hopeless class, who can never with propriety
become inmates of a general hospital.</p>

<p>An insane man, whether a convict or not, must always be an
object of deep sympathy. Whatever guilt attaches to him, we
lose sight of it in the terrible calamity by which he is overwhelmed.
The moment it becomes manifest that he has, through
the visitation of God, lost the control of his intellectual faculties,
so as to be exempt from the ordinary responsibilities of a reasonable
being, all his relations to society are changed. The
government which stood ready to charge home his guilt and
demand his punishment as an offender, offers him protection
and sympathy as a sufferer. The sword of justice is converted
into a sceptre of mercy, and so long as this dark cloud overshadows
him, the voice of the accuser is silent.</p>

<p>We apprehend there would be much difficulty in distinguishing
practically between those insane convicts, who might be
received into the State Hospital as ordinary patients, and those
who would require to be kept by themselves. So far as the safe
custody of the dangerous class is concerned, the number would
seem to be too small to justify the expense of “a separate building,
(having strictly a prison character,) erected upon the (hospital)
grounds,” as the trustees suggest. No class of prisoners
are more ingenious or more untiring in their efforts to escape
than the insane; and hence their safe keeping would be the chief
point of consideration in the construction of a building for their
reception. If separate provision is not made for all classes of insane
convicts, we should much question the expediency of making
it simply for the safe keeping of the dangerous. We would
rather ameliorate, as far as possible, their condition as convicts
in the cell, affording them extra diet, appropriate association,
amusement, &amp;c. Nothing would be gained by transferring them
from a cell in Philadelphia to a cell in Harrisburg, provided
they are to be strictly confined to either; and any relaxation of
this rigor which their convalescence might warrant, would be
attended with much less hazard in the prison-yard, than on the
hospital grounds.</p>

<p>But we have serious doubts, whether a general State Lunatic
Hospital should receive convicts of any class. We are aware,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
that the practice obtains to some extent, but whether, in a
majority of cases, the parties received can be properly called
convicts, there is much ground to question.</p>

<p>In the report of the New York State Lunatic Asylum, for
1851, we notice ten cases returned under the head of “imprisonment,”
eight of which are declared to be cases of “feigned
insanity,” and of course though “convicts,” they were not “insane.”
Of the other two, one became insane before trial, and
was of course, though insane, never properly a “convict.”
“Besides these ten,” says the report, “there have been sent to
us from prisons and gaols several others, who were cases of
genuine insanity, but who were doubtless insane when committed.”
Then they were never proper subjects of penal suffering,
and should not have been imprisoned, except for safe
keeping. In most of our State hospitals pay-patients are received
to some extent, and those who resort to them as institutions
of charity, should not be forced into discreditable
association. It is of great importance, that every thing attractive
should be presented in them, and every thing repulsive
avoided. The poverty-stricken are sometimes quite sensitive
on these subjects, and it is as inhuman as it is impolitic to violate
their feelings.</p>

<p>The attention of the British Parliament has been recently
called to this subject by a proposition of the commissioners of
lunacy, to establish a central asylum for “criminal lunatics” in
England and Wales, similar in character to that for Ireland, at
Dundrum, near Dublin. The commissioners say, that “it has
been frequently brought under their notice, that the friends and
relatives of patients, and also the patients themselves, when
conscious of being associated with “criminal lunatics,” have
considered such association a great and unnecessary aggravation
of their calamity.” There is some doubt expressed, whether
such feelings prevail to any considerable extent in institutions
where convict-patients are received; and to the question,
whether the dislike to the society of criminal lunatics ascribed
to patients and their friends, exists generally or only in those
cases which were brought specifically under the notice of the
commissioners, one medical witness says, that his own experience
is directly the reverse; that he has carefully watched,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
in order to detect any repugnance or unfriendly feeling among
the inmates of a county asylum, of which he has charge, towards
their fellow-patients, who were known to have committed
offences against the laws, and had not only failed to do so,
but had heard expressions of sympathy and pity. He thinks
there is much more tenderness felt for them by their fellow sufferers,
than by their sane neighbors.</p>

<p>There is also a considerable difference of opinion, not only
as to the classes of lunatics which the proposed asylum
should receive, but also as to the name both of place
and patients. Some would call it the State asylum, and
would open it to all criminal offenders of every station and
degree, who are exempted from the penalties of the law on
the ground of insanity. Of course it would have the character
of a general, and not of a pauper asylum, so as to afford
superior accommodation for those who could afford to pay.
Others would confine the use of such an asylum to the detention
and treatment of all lunatics of criminal disposition, whether
they have actually committed a crime or not. Some would completely
separate criminals who have become insane after conviction,
from those who have committed crimes under the influence
of insanity&mdash;the former, of whom only would be properly called
insane convicts. The distinction is obvious, viz., that an insane
person cannot become a convict, though a convict may become
insane. Others would make no distinction, but would put “all
lunatics detained under warrant from the government, on the
same footing.”</p>

<p>The discussion of the matter has awakened parliamentary
inquiry. On the 18th of March last, in the House of Lords,
the Earl of Shaftsbury moved an address to the Crown, touching
“the expediency of establishing a State asylum for the care
and custody of those who are denominated criminal lunatics,”
and he adduced several facts, to show the inexpediency of detaining
criminal lunatics in the same asylum with other patients.</p>

<p>The Earl of Derby thought any movement in this direction
would be premature, as a revision of the whole subject was
needful, before it could be determined what new legislation
would be expedient.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span></p>

<p>Lord Cranworth said, that nothing could be more mischievous
than mixing criminal lunatics with other lunatics; and he
also contended that the question of lunacy in criminal prosecutions,
should not be determined by juries; but that the only
point for them to decide, should be the fact&mdash;guilty, or not
guilty&mdash;leaving the question of sanity to be inquired into before
another tribunal, the constitution of which he was not then prepared
to define.</p>

<p>On an assurance from Lord Derby that the subject should receive
deliberate consideration, the motion was withdrawn.</p>

<p>As it seems unlikely that any provision will be presently
made in our State Hospital, either for convicts who become
insane, or who manifest insanity after they are received, or for
those who were insane when received, but were committed as
convicts, or for those who are committed for safe keeping
merely, or as lunatics with criminal intentions, or propensities,
we will venture to suggest a more minute classification of the
register of prisoners, and some specific recognition of these
classes in the arrangements of the Eastern Penitentiary.</p>

<p>If that institution is to serve the double purpose of a penitentiary
for convicts, and a house of detention or hospital for lunatics
of dangerous or criminal tendencies, let the departments
be kept distinct, and each be furnished with such attendance,
supervision, &amp;c., as their circumstances require. This arrangement
would very nearly resemble that at the Blockley Almshouse,
under which the two thousand paupers are received and
provided for in the appropriate wards of the house, while the
two or three hundred lunatics of various classes have a distinct
department, though all are under the same general superintendence.</p>

<p>So in the reports, the same distinction would be made between
the convicts proper, who are undergoing the process of
punishment, and those who from alienation of mind, antecedent
or subsequent to their reception as prisoners, are not proper
subjects of penal suffering, though they are proper subjects
of personal restraint, and, as such, have a lodging within the
prison walls. In a word, if our penitentiary must be used for
the detention or custody of lunatics whatever their character
or grade, let it have due credit as a hospital, and not suffer undeserved
reproach as a penitentiary.

<h2 id="Art_V_FINAL_REPORT_OF_THE_COMMITTEE_ON_THE_ERECTION"><span class="smcap">Art. V.</span>&mdash;FINAL REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE ERECTION
OF THE NEW GAOL FOR SUFFOLK COUNTY (MASS.), pp. 44.</h2>

<p>This document was presented, not long since, to the authorities
of the City of Boston; and, as it gives us the history of
a prison structure quite unique, in some respects, we think our
readers will be interested in a brief notice of it.</p>

<p>The County of Suffolk is made up of the City of Boston,
with a population of 140,000, and the town of Chelsea, with a
population of 7,000. The County Gaol, situated in Leverett
street, in the heart of the city, was, for almost twenty years,
the subject of complaint. It was irremediably defective in
construction, and incapable of being warmed or ventilated,
and afforded no means of classification. The site of it was ill
adapted to the purpose. It embraced 4800 square feet of land,
valued at $1.50 or $2.00 a foot.</p>

<p>In July, 1845, a plan of a new gaol, to be erected at South
Boston, was presented, and an order passed to proceed with the
work; but the people in the vicinity objecting to the measure,
it was not prosecuted farther; and nothing more was done till,
at the beginning of 1847, a letter<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> was addressed to the city authorities
by Mr. George Sumner, then in Paris, earnestly remonstrating
against the adoption of the associate or Auburn
system of discipline, and urging the construction of a County
Prison on the separate plan. The next year, it was determined
to rebuild on Leverett street; but before the work was commenced
a proposition was submitted for the purchase of an
eligible site on the margin of Charles river, which was adopted;
a purchase of nearly 200,000 superficial feet was made, at a cost
(with filling up, enclosing and protecting), of a fraction less than
$179,000; and a plan of construction agreed upon. From this
time the work went bravely on, till its completion, on the 25th
day of November last, when the prisoners were transferred
from the old gaol, in Leverett street, to their new quarters.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span></p>

<p>The cost of the building, exclusive of site, is a little short of
$200,000&mdash;the total expense being $373,525.90.</p>

<p>There is a centre octagonal building, with four wings&mdash;three
of which contain the cells&mdash;and the fourth is taken up by the
officers’ apartments. Each of the north and south wings measures
80 feet 6 inches in length, and 55 feet in width, and 56 feet in
height above the surface of the ground, and is divided into five
stories, each story containing ten cells, thus giving to each of
these two wings 50 cells. The east wing measures 164 feet 6
inches in length; 55 feet in width, and 56 feet in height above
the surface of the ground, divided into five stories, each with
24 cells, thus giving to this wing 120 cells. The cells in all
the wings are 8 by 11 feet, and 10 feet high. The hospital and
chapel occupy the fourth story of the west, or officers’ wing.
Each cell contains a window and a door; and the interior of
the whole prison is lighted from 28 windows in the outer walls,
each 10 feet wide and 33½ feet in length. The lower apartment
of the centre octagonal building contains the kitchen,
bakery and laundry, and in the upper is the central guard and
inspecting room. This apartment is 76⅓ feet square, and
stretches upward to the roof, in a clear, unoccupied space of 83⅔d
feet above the surface of the ground! The exterior walls
of the prison are of Quincy granite.</p>

<p>The opportunity was afforded us, some few days since, to
take a general view of this new and imposing structure. At
the time we were there workmen were engaged in erecting a
new furnace&mdash;the method of warming the cells having proved
quite inadequate. One might have supposed that this branch of
the science of prison architecture was sufficiently understood
to prevent such a disappointment. The inmates of the prison
were evidently suffering from this defect.</p>

<p>The <i>Separate System</i> is strictly enforced, except that no labor
is introduced, the prison being chiefly a house of detention
for debtors, witnesses and untried prisoners, upon whom
labor or other prison service may not be enforced. Thirty or
forty convicts were there, but under sentences so short as to
render it unprofitable to put them to work. Many were committed
for non-payment of fine and costs. The debtors have
a separate ward, as have also females and minors. Among the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
most obvious and important deficiencies may be mentioned
that of water. Tubs and cans are used in the cells. The rates
allowed for the board of witnesses are liberal, and an instance
was mentioned to us of a case so unimportant that the defendant
was bailed in the sum of only $30, while several witnesses
were then in confinement at the rate of $2.25 per week for their
board!</p>

<p>Whoever forms a judgment of the new gaol for Suffolk
County from the description in the Report of the Committee,
will find much cause to modify it upon a view of the premises;
and if we were not misinformed by resident officials, the structure
fails, in some very important particulars, to answer the
purpose which its projectors had in view. Some attribute its
defects to the unsteady counsels that presided over its erection,
and others to radical errors in the plan. As it has great advantages
over the old gaol, however, we are disposed to consider
it a step in advance, though certainly a very costly one.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It is a trite argument now, that the reformation of one child, while it is
far more hopeful than the reclamation of one old offender, is many degrees
cheaper than the punishment of that one. Experience proves that there is
scarcely a single case out of a thousand where the incipient disease of vice
has not yielded to the ameliorating treatment of kindness, and the removal
of the cause&mdash;poverty. Cheaper; because directly diminishing pauperism,
it, in the first place, reduces the amount we, as a community, pay for its
support; cheaper, because trying, catching and punishing one criminal, costs,
in some cases, an amount equal to the whole annual expense to feed, clothe,
and instruct a school-full of those who are to be prevented, by a simple process,
from becoming criminals; and cheaper, in this far higher sense, that
the reformation of one individual infinitely more than counterbalances the
expense of attempts, even where ineffectual, at reforming many.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Let the doubter of these positions call at some school where the lowest
order of human kind finds shelter, food and friends. We have seen such an
one&mdash;in the old country. We will introduce our readers to one of its pupils:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>He enters through a play-yard, where half a dozen little fellows, not very
fashionable, though quite decent in their attire, are amusing themselves
with tops and balls, and, if noise is a test of comfort, they are very happy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
Ascending an outside stair, he turns into a somewhat spacious apartment.
The roof indeed is not lathed and plastered, but there is all the more ventilation.
Everywhere, although things are homely enough, there is an air of
perfect cleanliness. Two or three excellent maps hang across and divide the
apartment, in one end of which are the boys, in the other the girls. Let
him look at either class, and what a strange study for the physiognomist or
phrenologist are the faces and foreheads of the pupils. Some have countenances
on which the traces of very early hard life are still visible; the lines
of misery are scarcely yet effaced. There are others, free, good brows,
which give unmistakeable evidence of shrewdness and talent; but on every
face there is contentment. The teachers in both divisions are busy at the
usual lessons; but, at the stranger’s visit, the classes are united, and an exercise
is gone through by individuals of either sex, chosen promiscuously.
In the back seat there starts up a little fellow about twelve years and a
half, who, caught half-naked, begging through the streets some fifteen
months ago, can read his Bible like the best of us; another reads a verse or
two of poetry; a third small youth, whose only occupation, till within a year
or so, was selling matches through the streets, is proved, after trial, to be far
the best speller in the place, where there are not a few very good ones, and
so on. The procedure is as orderly, and the advancement in secular and
Christian knowledge, of these once outcast and forsaken children&mdash;now clothed
and in their right mind&mdash;is as great as in any of the best public schools;
and seems to have been <i>at least</i> as rapid as among the children of what are
called the respectable classes of society. And now a hymn is sung by all
united, and, as they sit and sing, with folded arms and serious looks, there
is enough, whether in the whole scene, or in the music so touchingly
chanted, to send something like a tear into the corner of the eye. This
over, the ranks are marshalled, and then pass down to the room below,
where dinner waits; and, standing silently over the homely but substantial
fare, a sign is made, when every eye is closed, and grace is said aloud.
Enjoying themselves over their humble meal, our visitor leaves them, and
heartily joins us in recommending a visit to such a scene, and inviting
public attention to the principles on which these poor children are made
what they are. The leading and moving principle is that of kindness and
love&mdash;the endeavouring by all means to win them back to trust and confidence
in the kindness and love of teachers and friends; and looking at the
interests at stake, surely we may say that these are endeavours which a
Christian public <i>is bound</i> to second, especially when the seconding costs so
little, and is attended, as we have seen, with so great results.</p></blockquote>

<p>If any of the readers of our Journal would see this same wise and humane
policy exhibited in actual life, let him visit the Foster Home, (at what is
known as the Preston Retreat,) or the Children’s Home in Moyamensing,
and he will see how much seasonable care and kindness will do, towards
counteracting the downward tendencies of poverty and social corruption.
The following stanzas happily express the grand idea of social reformation.</p>

<p id="Novel_Residence_of_a_Den_of_young_Thieves"><span class="smcap">Novel Residence of a Den of Young Thieves.</span>&mdash;From a late London
paper, we take the following remarkable sketch of the rendezvous of a
gang of juvenile depredators. We have some such domicils, and some
such tenants of them, in our own cities.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Five ragged and filthy boys were charged with trespassing on property
belonging to the South Western Railway Company. An officer stated, that
at three o’clock, on the preceding morning, he examined the arches under
the terminus of the South Western Railway, and observed a hole, capable
of admitting a man’s body in one of them, situated in Granby street.
On looking through this aperture he discovered the prisoners, some of whom
had pipes in their mouths, smoking, while others were talking and laughing;
and all seemed as if they were perfectly secure from discovery in
their hiding place. The moment he threw light upon the groups, they
all started upon their feet, but the arch being enclosed on all sides, they
had no opportunity of escape, and were secured without difficulty. They
had worked holes, and undermined the arch in several places. In a hole,
covered with a piece of board, he found small parcels of coffee, sugar, pepper,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
candles, &amp;c. There was also a quantity of coals, and straw covered a
portion of the ground.</p>

<p>The magistrate then asked the witness if he knew the prisoners? The
officer said that they had all been convicted of petty offences. The officer
of the South Western Railway said that a number of their companions
were convicted some time ago for a similar offence, and that it cost the
Company £75 to repair the arch which they damaged by taking up their
quarters in it! Seventy-five pounds expended in good schooling, would
have gone far towards making good boys of them.</p>

<p>They were sentenced to imprisonment for various terms, from 25 to 40
days&mdash;probably to come out ten-fold more the children of evil than when
they went in.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;The value of the articles stolen may not in all exceed £5; there
were 33 previous convictions, of which <i>five</i> were by the Circuit Court of
Justiciary.</p>

<p>The investigations and trials of these ten persons must have cost the
country at least £1000, which would have thoroughly educated in an Industrial
School 200 children.</p>

<p id="Singular_Association"><span class="smcap">Singular Association.</span>&mdash;Lord Campbell tells us that he once heard a
judge at Stafford sentencing a prisoner convicted of uttering a forged £1
note, and after having pointed out to him the enormity of the offence,
and exhorted him to prepare for another world, the dignitary thus concluded:&mdash;“And
I trust that, through the merits and mediation of our blessed
Redeemer, you may there experience that mercy which a due regard
to the credit of the paper currency of the country forbids you to hope for
here.”</p>

<p id="Friendly_Beneficial_Societies"><span class="smcap">Friendly Beneficial Societies.</span>&mdash;There are 14,000 enrolled Friendly
Societies in England, having 1,600,000 members, an annual revenue amounting
to £2,800,000, and an accumulated capital of £6,400,000. A still greater
number of minor Friendly Societies are not enrolled, and do not, therefore,
possess the privileges and means of self-protection enjoyed by the former.
It is estimated that there are 33,223 societies in this position in England,
Wales, Scotland, and Ireland; having 3,052,000 members, an annual revenue
of £4,980,000, and with funds amounting to so large a sum as
£11,360,000, the praiseworthy accumulations of the purely industrial
classes. Indeed, half of the laboring male adult population are members
of beneficial societies.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span></p>

<p id="Diminished_Pauperism"><span class="smcap">Diminished Pauperism.</span>&mdash;It appears from a late return presented by Mr.
Baines, to the House of Commons, that there are well-nigh 26,000 fewer
adult able-bodied paupers in the workhouses of England than at the corresponding
period of last year. Of paupers, generally, no matter what their
sex or age, the diminution is somewhat more than 56,000.</p>

<p id="Intemperance_and_Insanity"><span class="smcap">Intemperance and Insanity.</span>&mdash;From an article in the Scottish Temperance
Review, it appears that returns from 25 Lunatic Asylums give 24 per
cent. of cases, caused by intemperance and vice. The total number of
lunatics in England and Wales is estimated at 26,516. Of these, 6,629
were reduced to their lamentable condition by intemperance. The sum
expended in England and Wales, for the maintenance of the insane, exceeds
$3,500,000.</p>

<p id="Metropolitan_Mortality"><span class="smcap">Metropolitan Mortality.</span>&mdash;From a very interesting and carefully
compiled statistical table, published in the London <i>Medical Times
and Gazette</i>, on the births and deaths in the Metropolis during the past
year, it appears, that the number of births was, 39,882 males, and 37,984
females, being a total of 77,866, or an excess of males over females of 1,898.
The number of deaths during the same period was 28,096 males, and 27,249
females, or a total number of 55,345 deaths, being an excess of deaths of males
over females of 847, or an excess of births over deaths of 22,517. The ages
at death were from 0 to 15, 25,712; from 15 to 60, 17,999; and from 60
and upwards, 11,362. The proportion of deaths, in 1851, to population in
the several districts of London, will be seen by the following:&mdash;In the west
districts, the population by the last census was 376,427, and the deaths in
1851 were 8,326; giving a proportion of one death to 45.2 inhabitants. In
the north district, population 490,396; deaths 10,860; or one death to 45.1
inhabitants. In the central district, population 393,256; deaths 9.474; or one
death to 41.1 inhabitants. In the east districts, population 485,522; deaths
11,819; or one death to 41.1 inhabitants. And in the south districts, population
616,635; deaths 14,884; or one death to 41.4 inhabitants. By a comparison
of the above with the former year 1850, it will be observed that the
births have increased, in 1851, by 2,554, and the deaths by 6,775. In 1850,
the excess of births over deaths was 26,738; while in 1851, it was only
22,517, being a decrease of 4,221. The deaths at the age of 0 to 15 have
increased over those of 1850 by 4,341; at the age from 15 to 60, by 1,634;
and from 60 and upwards, by 780.</p>

<p id="The_Great_Washed"><span class="smcap">The Great Washed!</span>&mdash;During 1851, there were 213,485 bathers at the
baths and washhouses establishment, situated in St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields,
London; the receipts amounted to £3,437 17<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> There were 50,290
washers: the number of hours’ washing was 103,836; and the receipts
under this head were £499 14<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> So at “the Model,” in Whitechapel,
there were during the same period 156,310 bathers, with £2,143 7<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, receipts.
There were 43,462 washers, who washed for 98,824 hours, and paid
£513 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> Taking the Metropolis generally, which as yet yields us reports
but of five establishments, of which one was opened on the 2nd of
September, we find that during the past year, there were 647,242 bathers,
who paid in all £9,141 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; and 132,251 washers, who paid £1,498 19<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>
The sum of the combined receipts is £10,640 7<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> The country returns
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
yield similar results for the periods during which the establishments have
been opened to the public.</p>

<p>The most remarkable indication of the state of trade in Birmingham
during the past year, is to be derived from the savings of the working classes.
These are shown in various ways. The accounts of the savings’-bank for
the year 1851, although not yet published, are made up, and it appears that
during the last twelve months, there has been an increase of 1,025 depositors,
and of upwards of £20,000 in deposits. The aggregate amount of
deposits, as will be shown by the report when it appears, is close upon
£400,000. But this is not all. There are numerous Freehold Land and
Building Societies in Birmingham, and not less than £70,000 has been paid
by the artizans of Birmingham into their various treasuries.</p></blockquote>

<p id="Scotch_Prisons"><span class="smcap">Scotch Prisons.</span>&mdash;The Twelfth Report of the Commissioners of the
Prisons of Scotland, shows that the average number of persons in custody
in the prisons of that kingdom, in 1850, was 2990 against 3143 in 1849.
The total expenditure on prison account for the last year was $220,000.</p>

<p id="Charities_in_London"><span class="smcap">Charities in London.</span>&mdash;Taking the whole of London, and not exempting
from the account such as may be correctly classed as metropolitan institutions,
as Greenwich Hospital, &amp;c., there are no less than 491 charitable
institutions, exclusive of mere local endowments and trusts, parochial and
local schools, &amp;c. These charities comprise&mdash;12 general medical hospitals;
50 medical charities for special purposes; 35 general dispensaries;
12 societies and institutions for the preservation of life and public morals;
18 societies for reclaiming the fallen and staying the progress of crime; 14
societies for the relief of general destitution and distress; 12 societies for relief
of specific descriptions of want; 14 societies for aiding the resources of
the industrious (exclusive of loan funds and savings-banks); 11 societies for
the deaf and dumb, and the blind; 103 colleges, hospitals, and institutions of
almshouses for the aged; 16 charitable pension societies; 74 charitable and
provident societies, chiefly for specified classes; 31 asylums for orphan and
other necessitous children; 10 educational foundations; 4 charitable modern
ditto; 40 school societies, religious books, church-aiding, and Christian
visiting societies; 35 Bible and missionary societies; showing a total of
491 (which includes parent societies only, and is quite exclusive of the numerous
“auxiliaries,” &amp;c.). These charities annually disburse, in aid of
their respective objects, the extraordinary amount of £1,764,736, of which
upwards of £1,000,000 is raised annually by voluntary contributions; the
remainder from funded property, sale of publications, &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p id="Prison_at_Athens"><span class="smcap">Prison at Athens.</span>&mdash;The following description of an Athenian prison is
extracted from a letter of an American citizen, (Rev. Dr. Jonas King,)
whose name is doubtless familiar to most of our readers as associated with
a very extraordinary exercise of arbitrary power.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="author">
<i>In the Prison of Athens, called Medrese, 9th March, 1852.</i><br />
</p>

<p>I am now in prison, and my name is inscribed among the vilest malefactors
of Greece, in a book kept for the purpose, in which the names of all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
who enter are written, with the age, description of their person, and the
crime of which they have been guilty. Mine is that of preaching the word
of God. That of two others here in chains, is the murder of seventeen persons.</p>

<p>The prison is called Medrese, which is a Turkish word meaning school;
and this is so called, because it was formerly used by the Turks as a school.
Besides myself, there are one hundred and twenty-five persons. A few
days since there were one hundred and eighty. These occupy eleven
small rooms, eight of which are about ten or eleven feet square, in each of
which are from eight to twelve persons. The other three rooms are perhaps
two or three times as large, and in each are confined twenty-five persons.
From these facts you can judge of the accommodations enjoyed here.
Most of them have no beds on which to sleep, and some not very warmly
clad. It is enough to make one’s heart ache to see them. The sight of
them made me feel that my trials and troubles were small.&mdash;Decent looking
men, and the vilest malefactors; men not yet tried, and who are perhaps
innocent, and those who have already been condemned for piracy, rape,
and murder; the youth who has committed perhaps his first crime, or no
crime at all; and those who have grown old in iniquity, and whose consciences
are seared as with a hot iron, are here crowded together in one
common mass, from which proceeds an odor by no means agreeable, even
now when the weather is cool, and which as the weather grows warm,
must become intolerable. And just think of sleeping in a little room, about
ten feet square, with ten or eleven others locked in with you for the night,
and only a small window in the door for air, and one by the side of it for
light, darkened by its thick heavy iron gates, and looking upon a small
court within.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is scarcely credible that a country so closely associated with the most
enlightened kingdoms of Europe, as Greece, and a city so conversant with
modern improvements in municipal economy as Athens, should be open to
the reproach of such folly and cruelty, as this paragraph discloses.</p>

<p id="New_York_State_Lunatic_Asylum"><span class="smcap">New York State Lunatic Asylum.</span>&mdash;The annual report of this institution
for the year 1851, furnishes the following facts: At the commencement
of the year there were 429 patients in the asylum; 366 have been
added, and 357 discharged during the year; of whom 112 were recovered,
15 much improved, 51 improved, 13 unimproved, and 45 died. The number
in the asylum at the date of the report was 425, of whom 220 were
males, and 215 females. Of those admitted during the year, the greatest
number were between the ages of 25 and 30 years. Of the causes of derangement,
the chief is stated to be intemperance, the number of patients
from this cause now in the asylum being 44 males and 1 female.</p></blockquote>

<p id="Emigration"><span class="smcap">Emigration.</span>&mdash;The commissioners of emigration of New York, in a recent
report to the legislature, state, that at the port of the city of New York
alone, there arrived during the year 1851, 289,601, of whom there were
natives of Ireland, 163,256; Germany, 69,883; other countries, 56,462;
making an increase of 75,998 over the preceding year. The emigrants
from Ireland exceed the whole number from other countries by 36,911.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
Of these, 85,000 were in a condition which required aid, being either sick
or paupers.</p>

<p>It is stated in the public prints, (and we have seen no contradiction of it,)
that a single Irish nobleman secured a passage to our shores of nineteen
hundred persons, at the rate of £2 per head, and ten shillings on their
arrival.</p>

<blockquote>

<p id="Boston_City_Marshals_Report"><span class="smcap">Boston City Marshal’s Report.</span>&mdash;By the annual report of the marshal
of the City of Boston, we learn that the whole number of robberies
reported at the marshal’s office during the year 1851, was 562; amount of
property lost and stolen, $44,418; amount of property recovered and restored
to owners, $26,131. The whole number of complaints and arrests
was 5,449, among which were, for larceny, 625; drunkenness, 1,465. Of
the whole number of arrests made, 1,110 were minors. There have been
969 complaints made to the Grand Jury, growing out of the sale of intoxicating
liquors; and fines, exclusive of costs, collected, amounting to
$12,474; and 36 have been imprisoned in the House of Correction, for different
periods, amounting in all to more than 10 years. The number who
apply at the marshal’s office for charity is very large, and all who were really
deserving have had their wants supplied by that department, from a
fund which is the proceeds of stolen and unclaimed goods, an accurate account
of which has been kept. “There is no greater imposition practised,”
says the report, “than the system of begging and soliciting charity. We
have now in the office a large number of written and printed papers which
have been taken from these impostors; and from one person we took <i>twenty-one</i>.”</p>

<p id="Health_of_the_Boston_Farm_School"><span class="smcap">Health of the Boston Farm School.</span>&mdash;The following remarkable
statement respecting the health and the mortality of the boys connected
with the Farm School, on Thompson’s Island, in Boston harbor, is made on
the authority of Robert Morrison, Esq., the Superintendent.</p>

<p>The number of boys in the school, June 1, 1851, was 85; January 1, 1850,
89; January 1, 1851, 97. The present number is 94, several having been recently
sent to places in the country. No death has occurred on the island
since August, 1845; which is the only time when a physician has been
sent for on account of sickness among the boys, for nearly ten years!</p>

<p>Under Providence, we consider this, in some measure, owing to a healthy
location, a simple but wholesome diet, exercise in the open air, and good
ventilation.</p>

<p>The average number of boys in the school, for several years, has not been
far from 80.</p>

<p id="Boston_Pauperism"><span class="smcap">Boston Pauperism.</span>&mdash;The Annual Report of the Boston Society for the
Prevention of Pauperism, estimates the cost of pauperism to that city, in
1840, at $43,454; in 1845, $45,000; and in 1850, $111,905! It also states
that in the past five years, the native American paupers have decreased
about 37 per cent., while foreign paupers, supported by the city, have increased
about 150 per cent.</p></blockquote>

<p id="Maine_State_Prison"><span class="smcap">Maine State Prison.</span>&mdash;When the State of Maine was about to erect a
new Penitentiary a few years ago, the commissioners were disposed to recommend
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
the separate system as decidedly preferable on every ground,
except that it costs more at first, and may not yield so large a profit on convict
labor. By the last report of the commissioners, we observe that of the
whole number of convicts, (eighty-four,) about one-half are employed in
making shoes&mdash;a business quite as profitably pursued in seclusion as in
association. Basket-making furnishes employment to such as, from age or
infirmity, are unable to perform hard labor, and this also might be as well
done in a cell. As to the finances of the institution, a special committee
of the legislature, appointed to investigate its affairs says, “they cannot
give any definite information,” but they portentously intimate, (what time
will probably reveal,) that if revenue is a prominent object in the management
of the prison, it will be defeated. “For any losses which may accrue
to the State,” say the commissioners, “we attach no blame to any former
warden or officer of the prison, for any neglect or want of care, but believe,
the loss arises from the universal credit system which has been too prevalent
in our State.” “We certainly hope so,” says a leading newspaper,
“for it is high time the State were realizing more from the prison economy
than it has yet done.”</p>

<p>We wish this notion of making penitentiaries a source of profit could be
eradicated, or absorbed in the higher and more important objects of making
them the means of instructing the minds of convicts, softening their asperities,
correcting their false views, elevating their motives, and counteracting
the corrupt influences by which they have been surrounded. These humane
purposes cannot be answered to any considerable extent under any system,
save that of <i>separation</i>, and it is from this conviction, and not from any
pride or pertinacity of opinion, that we advocate the universal adoption of
that principle.</p>

<p id="The_Maryland_Penitentiary"><span class="smcap">The Maryland Penitentiary.</span>&mdash;By the report made to the Maryland
Legislature, it appears the receipts of the institution, during the last year,
do not equal its expenses by the sum of $9,302 78. The average deficiency
in the receipts for the last four years has been 89,267 63, and the aggregate
deficiency for the same period 37,070 54. Various causes are stated
for this deficiency&mdash;the unequal competition which the manufacturers of
the prison have to sustain with those made by more improved machinery&mdash;the
loss of time and labor consequent on the necessity of teaching the most
of the convicts their employments&mdash;the prejudices which are entertained
against the prison manufactures, and the difficulty of selling them at remunerating
prices, being the principal causes to which it is to be attributed.
The number of persons received into the penitentiary during the year was
119; discharged by expiration of sentence during the year 44; pardoned
during the year 18.</p>

<p id="Poor_and_Insane_of_Rhode_Island"><span class="smcap">Poor and Insane of Rhode Island.</span>&mdash;Thomas R. Hazard, Esq., commissioner
to inquire into the condition of the public poor and insane of
Rhode Island, made his report to the Legislature at its late session. In
fifteen towns in the State, asylums for the poor are maintained. In sixteen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
towns, not having asylums, the poor are put to persons who will keep them
for the lowest sum, or are boarded out by contract. The average cost for each
individual per annum, in the asylums, is $51.50; for each individual, per
annum, of the latter class, $45.60.</p>

<p>The average number of poor, supported in asylums, is 500; all others,
229; total, 729. Whole cost of supporting the poor, including interest on
cost of asylums, $51,003.23. Insane persons in Rhode Island, 282. Idiots
and imbeciles, 136. Blind, 60. Deaf and dumb, 64.</p></blockquote>

<p id="Rhode_Island_Hospital"><span class="smcap">Rhode Island Insane Hospital.</span>&mdash;We have not been favored with Dr.
Ray’s last report, but we learn from other sources, that of 54 patients discharged,
during the year, 36 were cured, and 8 improved. There were 16
deaths. Of 420 insane persons in the State, only 180 are enjoying the advantages
of Hospital treatment.</p>

<p id="Charitable_Institutions_in_Indiana"><span class="smcap">Charitable Institutions in Indiana.</span>&mdash;<i>Hospital for the Insane.</i>&mdash;This
institution has 140 patients under treatment, and yet there are in the State
300 insane persons (exclusive of idiots) who are totally unprovided for.
Applications are rejected for want of room, and an immediate enlargement
of the buildings is contemplated. It is stated that there are in Indiana 442
insane, and 617 idiotic persons. Of the 292 patients who have been treated
in the hospital, only 78 were natives of Indiana.</p>

<p><i>Deaf and Dumb Asylum.</i>&mdash;One hundred and thirteen pupils were under
instruction at the date of the report, and the earnings of the pupils during
the year, are valued at $3,770. Only two deaths occurred during the year.</p>

<p><i>Institution for the Blind.</i>&mdash;Fifty-two pupils are under instruction, from
33 counties. “The superintendent is of opinion that all applicants of sound
mind, and not above twenty-one years of age, should be received, provided
they are otherwise qualified, reserving discretionary powers as to the rest.”
A new building is in progress, which will enlarge the accommodations so
as to admit every blind child in the State, who is capable of instruction.</p>

<p id="Charitable_Institutions_in_Alabama"><span class="smcap">Alabama.</span>&mdash;We are happy to observe, by the public prints, that the people
of Alabama have resolved to establish, forthwith, an Insane Hospital and
a Deaf and Dumb Asylum.</p>

<p id="Kentucky_Deaf_and_Dumb_Asylum"><span class="smcap">Kentucky Deaf and Dumb Asylum.</span>&mdash;The Annual Report of the Trustees
of the Deaf and Dumb Asylum shows that the institution is in a prosperous

of the institution are from Kentucky, 9 from Louisiana, 1 from Arkansas,
1 from Mississippi, and 1 from Tennessee.

<h4><i>From the Episcopal Recorder.</i></h4>

<p>This periodical gives a large amount of information on Prison Discipline, and
cannot fail to interest such as grieve over the sufferings occasioned by crime, and
regard the imprisoned criminal as still belonging to our common humanity, and
needing the commiseration of the wise and good.</p>

<h4><i>From the Public Ledger.</i></h4>

<p>We have received the October number of the Pennsylvania Journal of Prison

<h3>INTO THE ALLEGED TENDENCY OF THE SEPARATION OF CONVICTS, ONE FROM
THE OTHER, TO PRODUCE DISEASE AND DERANGEMENT.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">By a Citizen of Pennsylvania.</span> <i>Philadelphia</i>: E. C. &amp; J. Biddle. 1849.</h4>

<p>It is, as might possibly be anticipated from the residence of the author, an
elaborate and ardent defence of the separate system of confinement. The
charge of its peculiar tendency to induce disease and insanity, is altogether
denied, and the testimony of the successive physicians to the Eastern State
Penitentiary, during a term of nearly twenty years, goes very satisfactorily
to warrant the denial.</p>

<p>The author is not, however, inclined to rest at this, but carries the war into
the enemies’ camp. The chapter entitled Medical Practice, in a Congregate
Prison, is calculated to attract attention, from the positions laid down in it,
and their startling illustrations, deduced from the well known case of Abner
Rogers. It is not the time or the place for us to enter on this warmly controverted
subject, and we have noticed the work only on account of its bearing
on the subject of insanity, and as forming a part of its literature.&mdash;<i>Am. Journal
of Insanity, published by the Superintendent of the New York Lunatic Asylum,
July, 1850.</i></p>

<p>So far as the leading controversy, in regard to the rival systems of prison discipline,
is concerned, it seems to us to cover the entire ground with singular
ability.&mdash;<i>Princeton Review.</i></p>

<p>☞ A few copies of this pamphlet are still on hand, and may be had on application
to the publishers, corner of Fifth and Minor streets, or to any member of
the Acting Committee.

<h4>DESIGN AND PLAN OF THE WORK.</h4>

<p>The members of this venerable Institution, which has been mainly instrumental, in introducing
the great reform in Prison Discipline that has distinguished the last half century, have long felt the
need of such a medium of communication with the public as is now proposed. Their attention
has of late been more especially aroused to the importance of the measure, from the deep interest
which has been awakened in such reform; and from the misapprehension which prevails, as to the
true principles and results of what is termed the “Pennsylvanian,” or “Separate System.”</p>

<p>Of the intrinsic usefulness of a Journal of this nature, it is believed but one opinion can prevail
among the intelligent and humane. One of the most active and well-informed of those engaged in
the reform of Prisons, has justly remarked, that “judgment is but the result of comparison.” All
reasonable men, before deciding on a measure, will acknowledge the importance of becoming acquainted
with the history and results of similar efforts. Hence the necessity felt by all civilized nations,
of publishing and preserving public documents, reports, discussions, criticisms, &amp;c. In America
there is no adequate provision for the preservation of these, so far as they relate to prison reform;
they are scattered among an accumulation of pamphlets on other subjects, are frequently destroyed,
and are always difficult of access; and the labour which ought to furnish instruction for our future
progress, and for posterity, becomes too often merely temporary in its utility.</p>

<p>At the present time a greatly enhanced importance is attached to a publication of this kind, as a
medium of communication with foreign countries. Several of the governments of Europe are endeavouring
to ascertain the best system of Prison Discipline, with a view to its adoption; and although
the Society have no doubt which of the methods now in existence is the best, some Philanthropists
of the Old World are yet undecided.</p>

<p>It is from a knowledge of these facts and from a belief that it is due to themselves and the cause
of humanity, that the Society have been induced to undertake this publication.</p>

<h4>TERMS.</h4>

<p>This periodical is published quarterly; each number to contain at least 48 pages octavo. It will
be delivered without charge to members of the Society; but to those who are not members, the
price is $1 per annum, always in advance, or 25 cents a number.</p>

In those States where it is usual to transfer insane convicts to a Lunatic
Asylum, the boon would certainly have been extended to two of our convicts, and
thus the institution in which the mental disease originated would not have had to
account for its physical termination. This fact should be remembered, when comparing
our state of health with similar establishments, as it shows that the Eastern
Penitentiary has always had a double mortality to account for, that which is due to
it as a penal institution, as well as that which properly belongs to an Insane Asylum.</p></div>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
